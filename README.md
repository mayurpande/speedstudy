# Progress towards my learning goals

## 2018

My aim for 2018 is to finish off learning python properly, as I have been using it for the past year, and have built a few cool projects with it. I have a knowledge of flask. So I would like to finish of learning the ins-and-outs. Then I also would like to get back to learning JS and up my front-end skills. I also would like to learn django. I am going to do this using a mish-mash of @p1xt's Job Ready Python Guide, and other courses/books.

Other goals for 2018 not related to coding continue on practicing yoga, up it from 3 times a week to 5 times a week. Play football every Wednesday with my friends (and hopefully get picked for the team on Saturday's!). Start learning Spanish again, practice half-hour by myself and 20 minutes with my work colleague who is from Spain!

Right goals set now time to achieve them.
